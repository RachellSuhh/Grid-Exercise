        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The "three drink theory" is just classy hydration with a side of chaos: one for the mind (coffee, because brain cells need caffeine), one for the body (water, to undo the damage of being alive), and one for the soul (wine, because, honestly, you’ve earned it). It’s less about balance and more about keeping it together—barely.</p>
